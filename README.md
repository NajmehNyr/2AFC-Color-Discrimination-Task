# 2AFC Color Discrinmination Task
## Aims
This experiment estimate the threshold of two opponent colors (blue and yellow) using a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task in PsychoPy. It aims to study a intraocular transfer phenomenon of adaptation. As you will see, being adapted by blue will increase the threshold of blue and you will detect colors with little amount of blue as yellow.

## Experimental Description
Twenty color stimuli (10 yellow and 10 blue) were each presented 20 times to each participant. When code have been ran a dialogue box appears where you can choose the condition. (No adaptation & Adaptation)
### No adaptation
all the colors will be randomly displayed and you most press Y or B for going to the next trial.
### Adaptation
you will see the adaptation stimulus (RGB: 0, 0, 255) for 30s, then the colors will be displayed, between each color you'll see the adaptation stimulus again for 5s.
Color spectrum is accessible in colorbar.ipynb.
