### Participants
Twelve adult female subjects took part in the experiment, which comprised two experimental conditions. Across all participants and conditions, a total of 9,600 responses were recorded.

### Experimental Procedure
A Python script utilizing PsychoPy was developed to implement a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) color discrimination task. This design allowed participants to select the adaptation status (no adaptation or adaptation) and specify the eye undergoing adaptation.

### Design
Visualization scripts were employed during the experiment design phase to ensure that the selected colors would achieve a 75% performance threshold. The final color bar reflects the chosen stimuli. Sample data may be used to execute the visualization code.

### Statistical Analysis (upcoming)
MATLAB scripts were utilized for the majority of the final analyses. While I proposed most of the underlying statistical methods, Fatemeh Honarmand implemented the analyses using MATLAB.
