# Data
Twelve adult female subjects took part in the experiment, which comprised two experimental conditions. Across all participants and conditions, a total of 9,600 responses were recorded.

# Experimental Procedure
A Python script utilizing PsychoPy was developed to implement a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) color discrimination task. This design allowed participants to select the adaptation status (no adaptation or adaptation) and specify the eye undergoing adaptation.

# Design
- Visualization scripts were employed during the experiment design phase to ensure that the selected colors would achieve a 75% performance threshold.
- Sample data may be used to execute the visualization code
