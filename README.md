# Participants
Twelve adult female subjects took part in the experiment, which comprised two experimental conditions. Across all participants and conditions, a total of 9,600 responses were recorded.

# Experimental Procedure
A Python script utilizing PsychoPy was developed to implement a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) color discrimination task. This design allowed participants to select the adaptation status (no adaptation or adaptation) and specify the eye undergoing adaptation.

# Design
- Visualization scripts were employed during the experiment design phase to ensure that the selected colors would achieve a 75% performance threshold.
- The final color bar reflects the chosen stimuli.
- Reformat provides the format needed for statistical analysis. (upcoming)
- Sample data may be used to execute the visualization code.

# Statistical Analysis (upcoming)
MATLAB scripts were utilized for the majority of the final analyses. While I proposed most of the underlying statistical methods, Fatemeh Honarmand implemented the analyses using MATLAB.
